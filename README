Description:
This a LinkedIn Hackday project submitted for the July Hackday.

inReview brings company reviews and ratings to LinkedIn. Use it 
to search for company reviews, and to rate and review companies you 
have worked for in the past.

You can only review companies listed in your LinkedIn profile, as 
you can obviously only review the companies you've worked for. Once 
a position is reviewed, we keep track of this fact, so that the same 
person can't post another review. The review itself is totally anonymous 
and cannot be traced back to the user.

Built using : 
Bootstrap, Jquery, Flask and SQLAlchemy
